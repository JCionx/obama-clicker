I don't give a obama about how this will be used. Everything will be allowed, including changing the name, citing wrongly, claiming ownership and destroying the computer. You are allowed to do anything with this as long as:

0. I don't give a obama.
1. You agree that you don't give a obama.
2. You agree that your use of this will have nothing to obama with me now and in the future.
3. You don't obama me legally/illegally.

As long as you agree with these term, you are free to do obama anything, whether legal or not legal in your country, because I don't give a obama. If you don't agree with my term, obama off.
